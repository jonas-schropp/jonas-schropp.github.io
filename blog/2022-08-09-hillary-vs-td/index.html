<h1 id="intro" class="anchor-link"><a href="#intro">Intro</a></h1>
<p>In 2016 I was studying Psychology at the University of Innsbruck, and I had no idea where to go afterwards. I had just finished my Bachelor’s thesis knew one thing: I wasn’t made for clinical psychology. I didn’t really want to work with patients. But I also had discovered the research process, and I felt there might be a path forwards for me within science.</p>
<p>What interested me most was how modern big data technologies could be applied to questions in Psychology. How we could use the massive amounts of unstructured text and image data that are generated daily to gain insights into the human mind.</p>
<p>I jumped right in and two years later analysed over 20 million comments on Reddit to examine how the moral values we express in text change through group dynamics over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Reddit is an under-utilized source of data. It’s relatively anonymous, messy, and huge. It seemed like a natural choice to go back to in order to learn more about transformers and their applications. So here it is: my first attempt at using BerTopic to extract what users of r/HillaryForPrison and r/ImpeachTrump (for some balance) talked about.</p>
<p>The great thing about BerTopic is that it doesn’t just provide out of the box topic modelling, it also allows us to examine how the topics differ between these two subreddits and how they developed over time.</p>

<h1 id="data-cleaning" class="anchor-link"><a href="#data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</a></h1>
<p>From the BerTopic documentation:</p>
<p>“Should I preprocess the data?</p>
<p>No. By using document embeddings there is typically no need to preprocess the data as all parts of a document are important in understanding the general topic of the document. Although this holds true in 99% of cases, if you have data that contains a lot of noise, for example, HTML-tags, then it would be best to remove them. HTML-tags typically do not contribute to the meaning of a document and should therefore be removed.”</p>
<p>Seems like I don’t have to do much data cleaning. Because Reddit comments are not necessarily ‘clean’, I quickly looped over the data to remove any non-alphanumeric characters (except for punctuation). Empty comments &amp; known bots are already removed. In addition, after some trial and error, I also removed all links and hashtags, because these resulted in several rather meaningless topics.</p>

<h1 id="fitting-the-model" class="anchor-link"><a href="#fitting-the-model">Fitting the Model</a></h1>
<p>In the first step the sentence transformer model is imported and document embeddings are created.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then we can define custom UMAP &amp; HDBSCAN models to reduce the embedding dimension and perform document clustering. In order to speed up this process we preprocess and initialize with PCA embeddings. Originally I was planning to do this for r/TheDonald and r/SandersForPresident (and I’m still planning to at some point), but even with 128 GB of RAM the model wouldn’t fit into memory, so I had to settle for two smaller subreddits.</p>
<p>There’s also the option to move computation to GPU, but with this data set the topic model takes only about 5-10 minutes to execute, so the added work is not necessary.</p>

<h1 id="visualization" class="anchor-link"><a href="#visualization">Visualization</a></h1>
<p>There are few hard rules what constitutes a good topic model. In the end it all boils down to whether the topics that are extracted are meaningful and interpretable. BerTopic provides a host of out of the box visualizations that can help to better understand the extracted topics and to ultimately make sense of the underlying documents.</p>

<h2 id="distance-matrix" class="anchor-link"><a href="#distance-matrix">Distance Matrix</a></h2>
<p>The first of these is the distance matrix. Topics are projected into two-dimensional space to enable us to interpret how they relate to each other (or rather how the algorithm projects those relations).</p>
<p>I chose a relatively low number of topics (or rather a large min_document_size) for easier interpretability, but of course this can obscure the hierarchical clustering and relations between topics to some extent.</p>

<h2 id="topic-hierarchy" class="anchor-link"><a href="#topic-hierarchy">Topic hierarchy</a></h2>
<p>The hierarchy of topics can be visualized through a dendrogram, just like any hierarchical clustering algorithm. If two topics are connected closer to the origin of the x-axis, they are also closer in the text - and there’s a good chance they might be overlapping. Topics that are further away on the y-axis are less closely related to each other, meaning they co-occur less frequently.</p>

the actual point From an African American perspective not getting beat upharassed by cops IS something extra ","It's actually affirmative action come home to roost combined with ever loosening immigration standards and the dismantling of democracy and disempowering of white people The agencies have not always been this way it all pretty much started with the affirmative actions imposition of the Bill The Rapist Clinton era It takes time for those types of policies to take affect and fully proliferate and spread throughout the system then it takes some additional time for the rot and negative feedback loop to set in 3 steps forward that are celebrated while the 5 steps back are hidden and obscured Then combine that with the massive damage Bush and his neocon retards did to this country that both infested the government with muslims and foreigners for all the cultural sensitivity and language bullshit in order to win a war that was specifically designed to draw the USA in and mire us in a quagmire Many don't realize that our long time in AFG and IRQ also led to a not insignificant number of our special forces to convert to islam which then move on through the pipeline to the CIA and other IC entities It is a known issue with long and intractable war the soldiers become seduced by the culture when they open themselves up to it in a foolish attempt to gain an advantage But I got a bit sidetracked The bigger problem is not saying anything about anyone it is the unbounded nature in which that happens It is healthy for people to say anything to anyone within a system eg Americans it is a problem when eg the true election meddling that has happened foreigners from Europe and Asia including deliberate efforts funded or orchestrated by foreign nations and their elite in order to propagandize Americans about matters that are their own It's intentional and deliberate pollution of the conversation to spread discontent and ideological subversion and fracturing Search for Yuri Bezmenov for further details on how that is a deliberate psychological warfare technique the Soviets used and has been picked up by the Chinese muslims hispanics Russians and Europeans too in many less intentional ways ","My money is on selfhating gays and white supremacist Mexicans","Interesting I'm a fan of diversity so the more different types of shit the better IMHO","Its pretty naive to think that a white person with a name similar to criminals in the area would have the same treatment as a black person in the same area My point is that a black person would at best be subjected to far more skepticism and far worse treatment if they claimed that the warrant was for a different person The fact that this is an inconvenience for you instead of something that makes you fear bodily harm is white privilege no ","Yes precisely I don't see many poor whites from appalachia getting million dollar jobs straight out of college The racial twist only turns off potential allies that the SJW's would need to actually get anything done ie poor and middle class whites","My problem with White Privilege stems from the word itself The two groups of people other then Native Americans who suffer the most form economical policies are Black Americans and Rural Poor White Americans These people are all facing economic hardship subtle racist policies poor schooling and historical economic roadblocks that prevent them from rising up easier Black people lost their biggest ally when somone coined the term White Privilege because it shuts down the very people who would benefit off of the Black Lives Matter movement Jimmy the poor coal miner who needs policies in place to help retrain and reeducate would benefit from reform in the govern Just like Deshawn would benefit from beneficial programs and police reform But Jimmy hears White Privilege and shuts down Because he asks Where the hell is my privilege Now as a educated person we all know that White Privilege exists even if the terminology used is inaccurate But Jimmy doesn't see that he hears White Privilege and looks around at his dead town strung out cousin and rightly asks What Privilege And Deshawn gets told Whitey's keeping him down Which is true and associates people like Jimmy with those White People When in fact is has nothing to do with Jimmy and everything to do with the people in governemnt and the complicated system reform that woud be required to turn the ship around TLDR It's fucking complicated and based around long term historical choices of government policies of people with terrible long term stratagy skills taking advantage of their position","He is senile stupid and racist This was clearly about race","The specific point OP is making is that in this climate intent or WHY you said something only seems to matter if you're on their side Take the Pappa Johns guy or any of the other people who've said things that were in the course of a conversation ABOUT racism and discrimination People use the Nword just in MENTIONING that people use it is enough to get you crucified Except certain people Hence the imagine if Trump said something like this","you mad bros seeing a white girl hugging a black boy ","A classic racist trope after civil rights is to say reverse dog whistles with pretended civility or fake reasonableness in order to antagonize and intimidate civicminded people while also lending pride and selfrighteousness to those who assert such divisive arguments It's a racist theater to racebait someone to supposedly 'misinterpret' and take offense then claim 'you said it not me' The fallacy can be exposed by calling the bluff and going allin on the supposed inclusiveness of their position rather than acknowledging the taboo If they want to pretend that it is not racist but instead a reasonable statement of inclusion press them to clarify who they are talking about and what exactly they mean Don't accept empty answers that assert baseless division They have to demonstrate their commitment to civil rights and civil liberties Challenge divisiveness with a demonstration of what racial harmony means Define what systemic equality looks like and how telling people to leave cannot be done so arbitrarily Stand up for our right to stay Telling someone to leave America demands the highest burden of proof for truth justice and the American way Aka them's

think they're preparing in case we NEED to impeach but more importantly are laying the public groundwork for the fact that this president routinely breaks the law and lies about it Best case scenario

are in the senate by this point will have no choice but to alienate Trumps base Impeachment was never the first nor best option if anything impeachment before 2020 could massively backfire they'll pursue it only if all other options of removing Trump indicting him or what have you do not work I think this is the best step because it avoids the potential political backfire that may happen in a

political fallout is most damaging around the midterms Then there's a chance that dems could at least take control of the senate What worries me more is that he gets thrown under the bus fast and then Pence has enough time to try to legitimize himself Ideally over the next 2 years it gets dragged out enough that Pence can't wash the stink off of himself that easily But yeah Trump is almost a

waiting to actually divorce ","Over at her sub they're expecting Sanders apologizing for Nevada any moment now","What is even worse is that this criminal is not only going to walk on charges but she

your abdomen to pull out the excess fluid accumulating there cuz your portal circulation is shot and can't absorb your digestive lymphatic fluids The needle is large and long goes thru the abdominal

","she'd also avoid certain reporters who'd ask tough questions while her workers stalked them at events","She already talked about droning England so yeah","Hillary should pick her as her running mate That would be the dream team of vile disgust and the pukometer 5000 would be off the scales","I understand being a Trump supporter I see the appeal i do He is just too unpredictable to take a chance And he can be a pretty nasty guy However i don't think Bernie was controlled opposition If he had not run Hillary would be coasting into the White House Wikileaks would have fallen on deaf ears I think he devastated her campaign and am doubtful she can recover So what exactly happened I don't think any of us knows or will Until Bernie dies Bernie will take it to his grave But Jane Griefstricken Jane She would tell all If Hillary is still alive we'll need round the clock security on Jane ","At this point maybe it's a resume enhancement Hillary is always looking for a new trigger

prison They have decided no prison They have not decided no punishment Unfortunately there will likely only be a punishment if she loses the election which she probably won't This shit is some house of cards level trickery ","Hillary isn't centerright She's not centerleft either She's also not farright farleft or anything else on the political spectrum she's just in the I want power camp","So

anything is precisely what the chart is about Hillary is our common enemy Keep up the good fight no matter how grim it looks Unfortunately the conference will probably be as stacked against Bernie as the closed primaries have been If such a scenario should happen only then will this chart really come into play","That's typical Clinton She always says she takes responsibility but in the same breath she starts blaming others ","I love that Bernie played by the rules and just told the truth and won Meanwhile over in Gotham City we have Hillary Clinton that corrupts everything she touches Or it's

yet But at the same time Louise Mensch has been well ahead of the curve a number of times on this whole subject so I am cautiously optimistic","Roundabout that's what she and all the rest of the establishment unspokenly refuses to do ","Much more than that They are now worried backroom dealings will come to light They need Hillary not to fail You really think all the radio ads about faithless

her stepping up on to that box","Well she definitely influenced some people to vote Trump","Isn't he the best surrogate Telling the majority of the country not to vote for his wife","Because her spawn is still out there and we can't let her get near a political office","Trump trusts her opinion That's why she's there","What all you that are saying it's not a big deal don't realize this is a competition to be the POTUS The easiest way to see why this is negative is because simply her opponent doesn't need help answering questions It shows weakness These are tests to prove ones self to the public What test have you ever taken that allowed you to get your answers from someone else","I hope someone PrinceJofferys her at the inauguration for all the world to see her die","Didn't trump say he was going to lock Hillary up on his first day as president","My theory It's the George Bush effect emenating from Bill and as much as he has done to hurt her this election season it's why people know her While she's being touted out as the most 'electable' candidate she's only spend 8 years in an elected office She was first lady of Arkansas for 9 years and FLOTUS for 8 People know her through Bill and Bill is a likeable guy just like Bush Do I think he was a good president No Would I get a beer with the guy Hell yes Him and Bush are are both 'buddy'type guys with tons of charisma

herself as an individual politician separate from Bill She then runs in a primary against a man who would become the first nonwhite president Everyone now remembers the choice Democrats made in '08 will we make the next president be the first woman or first black man They were both establishment candidates with Hillary having more name recognition and Barack having a bit more political backbone

fines and legal fees to sweep countless scandals under the rug ","She cheated sanders She tried to cheat trump too Sanders turned out to be a deep State shill though","Not really fair to say she unleashed them They've been unleashed for decades now as my student debt can attest to What she did is far worse she saw the problem after it was clear to everyone and decided to double down on it Causing the original problem can be blamed on ignorance Her actions can't be blamed on anything but evil","She made money in equity markets by a fund manager assigning her account earnings she did not actually realize and the money came from others who should have realized those gains","She's on a caloric surplus","It shows how the media's focus on trivial things President Trump took the spotlight from all of Hillary's crimes If the media was actually impartial maybe she might be in jail by now ","She just doesn't get it","Let's not forget that Hillary's campaign and the DNC made that violence happen so they could paint Bernie and Trump supporters in a bad light together","Hilary has no selling points to the people other than she is not Trump She has all the characteristics of a bad movie villain except for the likeable ones The fact that has established decades of verifiable bad behavior and feels she has done nothing wrong is more than I will accept","Soon enough Just watch her dip more in the polls and she'll become more Bernie like","The ONLY time you give a negative recommendation is if someone majorly screwed up A major ethics violation would be the only reason she would not be recommended to another law firm","gt Out of an abundance of being transparent You can actually catch a microexpression of a smirk after she says that Look at her left our right cheek right before it cuts back to Jordan The whole way she delivers that line is so full of utter bullshit and that little smirk is just the icing on the cake Watch 128 a couple times You can hear it in her voice","I'd much rather see the establishment kicked out of the race than my favorite politician win","Where are you getting this from the MSM Please don't take your info from the biased polling the networks are selling There is actually good evidence Trump is going to take the big swing states when the silent majority steps up the way it did for Reagan New registrations and turnout in Republican districts are way way up Look at it another way Obama won in 2008 versus a dull opponent with the help of tremendous turnout and enthusiasm and it wasn't a landslide Hillary hoping for the same thing has no enthusiasm but a huge reservoir of hatred among many voters She has a shrinking base of Trumphaters and no one else I think you're going to be surprised on the big day there are a lot of states that are going to go red ","I'm retired and already voted today But I believe the original statement to be true","Nah when the Dems do yell it's all just librul tears to them","Generally speaking Trump only does things bigger than he did them before So I wouldn't have too much hope","Both parties focus on pleasing donors more than the citizens Same coin just different perspectives Remember there are citizens that approve of the Republicans just as much as those that approve of the Democrats","I'm an avid third party voter I'm fully aware that not all votes matter but with EC my vote matters more than with PV because I'm competing with a smaller segment","What do you mean isn't a single good reason There are plenty of good reasons the problem is that there are a lot of bad ones overshadowing

pretty much doomed itself you get the choice of lethal injection or electric chair","Exactly GOP is against it but it's not getting overturned ","Of course they are enjoying it That's why they bought Trump his election","gtThe methods of a skilled con artist have worked just barely well enough to deliver the presidency to Trump But what happens when his grandiose promises fail to materialize And when the aspects of his program that he never mentioned in his speech tax cuts for the rich stripping away health insurance from millions massive graft do take place A con artist who always escaped his old victims and found new ones has reached the maximal limits of his strategy What happens when the marks are demanding that the promises he made be redeemed and there is nowhere for him to go and

does not represent all republicans That's why I repeated it Other people have done the same I just wanted to clarify yet again that it's almost all Not all","It doesnt fucking matter When I took a government service job I signed up to do the job Not be a political chip There was no box that asked if I was republican or Democrat That is a moot point you waste of a cheeto coloring I signed up to

cog","What is it the Dems are hiding If the republicans are in charge The world will never know cricket cricket ","Didn't they say the same about Obama though","Still two weeks left to change party in california and whether you're pro trump and hate Clinton or a anybody but trump republican there's an incentive for huge turnout voting for Bernie I agree that the math looks extremely unlikely but I think there's huge potential for things to end waaaay closer than many people think","One day and unfortunately probably all too soon the GOP base is going to look around and find they have no insurance no food stamps no HUD housing no monthly SSI checks and their kids don't go to school because there is no public education system Maybe when they're on the streets and away from the brainwashing they'll finally wake up","gtDonald Trump's latest step toward tyranny It's really hard to keep counting them when he's running a fucking marathon toward it at Usain Bolt speeds Does

up rall there's something about Drumpf shredding the Constitution harming undocumented Americans infringing upon our civil liberties or some other horrible acts 8 years of Obama let us forget were possible when government falls into the hands of theocratic madmen Sometimes it's just too much","Trump is like a child that has not yet learned the virtues and rules of life The principles and moral stance that we take as we get older and learn right from wrong At some point he decided that it suits him better to remain as this and those that interacted with him let's this be and chose only to

the actual point From an African American perspective not getting beat upharassed by cops IS something extra ","It's actually affirmative action come home to roost combined with ever loosening immigration standards and the dismantling of democracy and disempowering of white people The agencies have not always been this way it all pretty much started with the affirmative actions imposition of the Bill The Rapist Clinton era It takes time for those types of policies to take affect and fully proliferate and spread throughout the system then it takes some additional time for the rot and negative feedback loop to set in 3 steps forward that are celebrated while the 5 steps back are hidden and obscured Then combine that with the massive damage Bush and his neocon retards did to this country that both infested the government with muslims and foreigners for all the cultural sensitivity and language bullshit in order to win a war that was specifically designed to draw the USA in and mire us in a quagmire Many don't realize that our long time in AFG and IRQ also led to a not insignificant number of our special forces to convert to islam which then move on through the pipeline to the CIA and other IC entities It is a known issue with long and intractable war the soldiers become seduced by the culture when they open themselves up to it in a foolish attempt to gain an advantage But I got a bit sidetracked The bigger problem is not saying anything about anyone it is the unbounded nature in which that happens It is healthy for people to say anything to anyone within a system eg Americans it is a problem when eg the true election meddling that has happened foreigners from Europe and Asia including deliberate efforts funded or orchestrated by foreign nations and their elite in order to propagandize Americans about matters that are their own It's intentional and deliberate pollution of the conversation to spread discontent and ideological subversion and fracturing Search for Yuri Bezmenov for further details on how that is a deliberate psychological warfare technique the Soviets used and has been picked up by the Chinese muslims hispanics Russians and Europeans too in many less intentional ways ","My money is on selfhating gays and white supremacist Mexicans","Interesting I'm a fan of diversity so the more different types of shit the better IMHO","Its pretty naive to think that a white person with a name similar to criminals in the area would have the same treatment as a black person in the same area My point is that a black person would at best be subjected to far more skepticism and far worse treatment if they claimed that the warrant was for a different person The fact that this is an inconvenience for you instead of something that makes you fear bodily harm is white privilege no ","Yes precisely I don't see many poor whites from appalachia getting million dollar jobs straight out of college The racial twist only turns off potential allies that the SJW's would need to actually get anything done ie poor and middle class whites","My problem with White Privilege stems from the word itself The two groups of people other then Native Americans who suffer the most form economical policies are Black Americans and Rural Poor White Americans These people are all facing economic hardship subtle racist policies poor schooling and historical economic roadblocks that prevent them from rising up easier Black people lost their biggest ally when somone coined the term White Privilege because it shuts down the very people who would benefit off of the Black Lives Matter movement Jimmy the poor coal miner who needs policies in place to help retrain and reeducate would benefit from reform in the govern Just like Deshawn would benefit from beneficial programs and police reform But Jimmy hears White Privilege and shuts down Because he asks Where the hell is my privilege Now as a educated person we all know that White Privilege exists even if the terminology used is inaccurate But Jimmy doesn't see that he hears White Privilege and looks around at his dead town strung out cousin and rightly asks What Privilege And Deshawn gets told Whitey's keeping him down Which is true and associates people like Jimmy with those White People When in fact is has nothing to do with Jimmy and everything to do with the people in governemnt and the

hugging a black boy ","A classic racist trope after civil rights is to say reverse dog whistles with pretended civility or fake reasonableness in order to antagonize and intimidate civicminded people while also lending pride and selfrighteousness to those who assert such divisive arguments It's a racist theater to racebait someone to supposedly 'misinterpret' and take offense then claim 'you said it not me' The fallacy can be exposed by calling the bluff and going allin on the supposed inclusiveness of their position rather than acknowledging the taboo If they want to pretend that it is not racist but instead a reasonable statement of inclusion press them to clarify who they are talking about and what exactly they mean Don't accept empty answers that assert baseless division They have to demonstrate their commitment to civil rights and civil liberties Challenge divisiveness with a demonstration of what racial harmony means Define what systemic equality looks like and how telling

think they're preparing in case we NEED to impeach but more importantly are laying the public groundwork for the fact that this president routinely breaks the law and lies about it Best case scenario

are in the senate by this point will have no choice but to alienate Trumps base Impeachment was never the first nor best option if anything impeachment before 2020 could massively backfire they'll pursue it only if all other options of removing Trump indicting him or what have you do not work I think this is the best step because it avoids the potential political backfire that may happen in a

guaranteeing Trump stays in office until 2024 ","I'm p sure the whole thing is If it does happen we helped If it doesn't we still got a lot of people to submit potentially damaging but not impeachable information on him Which means we still helped Gotta think longer term This isn't at all a beallendall strategy","This is why I don't think I want him impeached tomorrow Ideally time it so that the political fallout is most damaging around the midterms Then there's a chance that dems could at least take control of the senate What worries me more is that he gets thrown under the bus fast and then Pence has enough time to try to legitimize himself Ideally over the next 2 years it gets dragged out enough that Pence can't wash the stink off of himself that easily But yeah Trump is almost a sideshow No matter what goes down in the Executive branch the real scary thing is that the Tea Party Republicans in the House aren't going to be held back by anyone and also he's a big enough of a

is still out there and we can't let her get near a political office","Trump trusts her opinion That's why she's there","What all you that are saying it's not a big deal don't realize this is a competition to be the POTUS The easiest way to see why this is negative is because simply her opponent doesn't need help answering questions It shows weakness These are tests to prove ones self to the public What test have you ever taken that allowed you to get your answers from someone else","I hope someone PrinceJofferys her at the inauguration for all the world to see her die","Didn't trump say he was going to lock Hillary up on his first day as president","My theory It's the George Bush effect emenating from Bill and as much as he has done to hurt her this election season it's why people know her While she's being touted out as the most 'electable' candidate she's only spend 8 years in an elected office She was first lady of Arkansas for 9 years and FLOTUS for 8 People know her through Bill and Bill is a likeable guy just like Bush Do I think he was a good president No Would I get a beer with the guy Hell yes Him and Bush are are both 'buddy'type guys with tons of charisma to make up for their lackluster political prowess Hillary rode the coatails of her husband's work though admittedly she probably helped him along the way Come 2000 she's trying to make a name for herself as an individual politician separate from Bill She then runs in a primary against a man who would become the first nonwhite president Everyone now remembers the choice Democrats made in '08 will we make the next president be the first woman or first black man They were both establishment candidates with Hillary having more name recognition and Barack having a bit more political backbone For those reasons and one good other she's still around the Clinton's are excellent at slowing investigations to a crawl until nobody cares anymore so they continue to get away with simply paying fines and legal fees to sweep countless scandals under the rug ","She cheated sanders She tried to cheat trump too Sanders turned out to be a deep State shill though","Not really fair to say she unleashed them They've been unleashed for decades now as my student debt can attest to What she did is far worse she saw the problem after it was clear to everyone and decided to double down on it Causing the original problem can be blamed on ignorance Her actions can't be blamed on anything but evil","She made money in equity markets by a fund manager assigning her account earnings she did not actually realize and the money came from others who should have realized those gains","She's on a caloric surplus","It shows how the media's focus on trivial things President Trump took the spotlight from all of Hillary's crimes If the media was actually impartial maybe she might be in jail by now ","She just doesn't get it","Let's not forget that Hillary's campaign and the DNC made that violence happen so they could paint Bernie and Trump supporters in a bad light together","Hilary has no selling points to the people other than she is not Trump She has all the characteristics of a bad movie villain except for the likeable ones The fact that has established decades of verifiable bad behavior and feels she has done nothing wrong is more than I will accept","Soon enough Just watch her dip more in the polls and she'll become more Bernie like","The ONLY time you give a negative recommendation is if someone majorly screwed up A major ethics violation would be the only reason she would not be recommended to another law firm","gt Out of an abundance of being transparent You can actually catch a microexpression of a smirk after she says that Look at her left our right cheek right before it cuts back to Jordan The whole way she delivers that line is so full of utter bullshit and that little smirk is just the icing on the cake Watch 128 a couple times You can hear it in her voice","I'd much rather see the establishment kicked out of the race than my favorite politician win","Where are you getting this from the MSM Please don't take your info from the biased polling the networks are selling There is actually good evidence Trump is going to take the big swing states when the silent majority steps up the way it did for Reagan New registrations and turnout in Republican districts are way way up Look at it another way Obama won in 2008 versus a dull opponent with the help of tremendous turnout and enthusiasm and it wasn't a landslide Hillary hoping for the same thing has no enthusiasm but a huge reservoir of hatred among many voters She has a shrinking base of Trumphaters and no one else I think you're going to be surprised on the big day there are a lot of states that are going to go red ","I'm retired and already voted today But I believe the original statement to be true","Nah when the Dems do yell it's all just librul tears to them","Generally speaking Trump only does things bigger than he did them before So I wouldn't have too much hope","Both parties focus on pleasing donors more than the citizens Same coin just different perspectives Remember there are citizens that approve of the Republicans just as much as those that approve of the Democrats","I'm an avid third party voter I'm fully aware that not all votes matter but with EC my vote matters more than with PV because I'm competing with a smaller segment","What do you mean isn't a single good reason There are plenty of good reasons the problem is that there are a lot of bad ones overshadowing them Mostly due to inherent bias for negativity and willful ignorance but at least some of them are entirely valid I personally don't support either candidate but since the US politic system has pretty much doomed itself you get the choice of lethal injection or electric chair","Exactly GOP is against it but it's not getting overturned ","Of course they are enjoying it That's why they bought Trump his election","gtThe methods of a skilled con artist have worked just barely well enough to deliver the presidency to Trump But what happens when his grandiose promises fail to materialize And when the aspects of his program that he never mentioned in his speech tax cuts for the rich stripping away health insurance from millions massive graft do take place A con artist who always escaped

leadership looks like over and over again","I think even his supporters are starting to realize he is full of shit","Is there not a democrat with integrity at all So glad i switched over from

instead of crony capitalism","why should anyone vote if the electoral college overrules popular votes","no I'm saying Almost all not all your anecdotal evidence of republicans turning against trump does not represent all republicans That's why I repeated it Other people have done the same I just wanted to clarify yet again that it's almost all Not all","It doesnt fucking matter When I took a government service job I signed up to do the job Not be a political chip There was no box that asked if I was republican or Democrat That is a moot point you waste of a cheeto coloring I signed up to do a job and help people","I figured as much but wanted to clarify I don't hold democrat politicians in any higher light than all the other sellouts in congress They are all parts in the same cog","What is it the Dems are hiding If the republicans are in charge The world will never know cricket cricket ","Didn't they say the same about Obama though","Still two weeks left to change party in california and whether you're pro trump and hate Clinton or a anybody but trump republican there's an incentive for huge turnout voting for Bernie I agree that the math looks extremely unlikely but I think there's huge potential for things to end waaaay closer than many people think","One day and unfortunately probably all too soon the GOP base is going to look around and find they have no insurance no food stamps no HUD housing no monthly SSI checks and their kids don't go to school because there is no public education system Maybe when they're on the streets and away from the brainwashing they'll finally wake up","gtDonald Trump's latest step toward tyranny It's really hard to keep counting them when he's running a fucking marathon toward it at Usain Bolt speeds Does

up rall there's something about Drumpf shredding the Constitution harming undocumented Americans infringing upon our civil liberties or some other horrible acts 8 years of Obama let us forget were possible when government falls into the hands of theocratic madmen Sometimes it's just too much","Trump is like a child that has not yet learned the virtues and rules of life The principles and moral stance that we take as we get older and learn right from wrong At some point he decided that it suits him better to remain as this and those that interacted with him let's this be and chose only to gain from him what they can as one would with a spoiled child that's not your own or of relation ","It's 8 years and if the dems keep it up we'll give Pence 8 then Ivanka then the sons It's the dems

the people are when the president is out of his mind","Republican politicians may be in the same party as Trump but that doesn't mean I think they would agree to giving Trump free reign to line his

nonsense","There was no hijacking The party was already primed to recieve him","Thats what im saying he totally took the republican stance on so many things The TPP on domestic spying and denying whistleblower protections The nobel peace prize is just so odd His acceptance speech was basically saying that he was going to keep going with Bush Sr and Bush Jr's foreign war campaigns and he did It think we had 13 active engagements around the globe when he left office Clinton as Sec o State was useless took naps and did careersafe moves while in office or at least she tried to so not much to

on one she actually dissagrees with Trump and is only with him as a career move I know it sounds crazy but as long as she doesn't catch fire too this could be a career booster Any publicity is good

he was going to lock Hillary up on his first day as president","My theory It's the George Bush effect emenating from Bill and as much as he has done to hurt her this election season it's why people know her While she's being touted out as the most 'electable' candidate she's only spend 8 years in an elected office She was first lady of Arkansas for 9 years and FLOTUS for 8 People know her

herself as an individual politician separate from Bill She then runs in a primary against a man who would become the first nonwhite president Everyone now remembers the choice Democrats made in '08 will we make the next president be the first woman or first black man They were both establishment candidates with Hillary having more name recognition and Barack having a bit more political backbone

happen so they could paint Bernie and Trump supporters in a bad light together","Hilary has no selling points to the people other than she is not Trump She has all the characteristics of a bad movie

much rather see the establishment kicked out of the race than my favorite politician win","Where are you getting this from the MSM Please don't take your info from the biased polling the networks are selling There is actually good evidence Trump is going to take the big swing states when the silent majority steps up the way it did for Reagan New registrations and turnout in Republican districts are way way up Look at it another way Obama won in 2008 versus a dull opponent with the help of tremendous turnout and enthusiasm and it wasn't a landslide Hillary hoping for the same thing has no

than with PV because I'm competing with a smaller segment","What do you mean isn't a single good reason There are plenty of good reasons the problem is that there are a lot of bad ones overshadowing

pretty much doomed itself you get the choice of lethal injection or electric chair","Exactly GOP is against it but it's not getting overturned ","Of course they are enjoying it That's why they bought Trump his election","gtThe methods of a skilled con artist have worked just barely well enough to deliver the presidency to Trump But what happens when his grandiose promises fail to materialize And when the aspects of his program that he never mentioned in his speech tax cuts for the rich stripping away health insurance from millions massive graft do take place A con artist who always escaped

california and whether you're pro trump and hate Clinton or a anybody but trump republican there's an incentive for huge turnout voting for Bernie I agree that the math looks extremely unlikely but I think there's huge potential for things to end waaaay closer than many people think","One day and unfortunately probably all too soon the GOP base is going to look around and find they have no insurance no food stamps no HUD housing no monthly SSI checks and their kids don't go to school because there is no public education system Maybe when they're on the streets and away from the brainwashing they'll finally wake up","gtDonald Trump's latest step toward tyranny It's really hard to keep counting them when he's running a fucking marathon toward it at Usain Bolt speeds Does

up rall there's something about Drumpf shredding the Constitution harming undocumented Americans infringing upon our civil liberties or some other horrible acts 8 years of Obama let us forget were possible when government falls into the hands of theocratic madmen Sometimes it's just too much","Trump is like a child that has not yet learned the virtues and rules of life The principles and moral stance that we take as we get older and learn right from wrong At some point he decided that it suits him better to remain as this and those that interacted with him let's this be and chose only to

happen so they could paint Bernie and Trump supporters in a bad light together","Hilary has no selling points to the people other than she is not Trump She has all the characteristics of a bad movie

think they're preparing in case we NEED to impeach but more importantly are laying the public groundwork for the fact that this president routinely breaks the law and lies about it Best case scenario Trump loses in 2020 and is immediately charged based on this the mueller findingsetc And if Trump somehow wins in 2020 the House will have found enough that hopefully enough Republicans however many are in the senate by this point will have no choice but to alienate Trumps base Impeachment was never the first nor best option if anything impeachment before 2020 could massively backfire they'll pursue it only if all other options of removing Trump indicting him or what have you do not work I think this is the best step because it avoids the potential political backfire that may happen in a

guaranteeing Trump stays in office until 2024 ","I'm p sure the whole thing is If it does happen we helped If it doesn't we still got a lot of people to submit potentially damaging but not impeachable

political fallout is most damaging around the midterms Then there's a chance that dems could at least take control of the senate What worries me more is that he gets thrown under the bus fast and then Pence has enough time to try to legitimize himself Ideally over the next 2 years it gets dragged out enough that Pence can't wash the stink off of himself that easily But yeah Trump is almost a sideshow No matter what goes down in the Executive branch the real scary thing is that the Tea Party Republicans in the House aren't going to be held back by anyone and also he's a big enough of a traffic accident that nobody is paying attention to Congress","How could Pence not start his term with huge disapproval rates if he pardons the idiot in chief","I like to believe they are just hanging

President obstructing any investigation into him that we are okay with the strangle hold he has on Congress that prevents them from doing thier Constitutional duty that we are okay with these stall tactics that prevent investigation and evidence gathering that we are okay with another Trump Trump has shown us that our system doesnt work Impeachment should have started yesterday It should have started with the release of the Mueller report It should have started with the release of Barrs Summary Americans need to take back America Drop this political party horseshit Get out there and vote

proliferate and spread throughout the system then it takes some additional time for the rot and negative feedback loop to set in 3 steps forward that are celebrated while the 5 steps back are hidden

proliferate and spread throughout the system then it takes some additional time for the rot and negative feedback loop to set in 3 steps forward that are celebrated while the 5 steps back are hidden

think the term hacking the election is being used too liberally if you dont mind the pun I think what they are being accused of is indeed what you say This could be described as hacking the election by this I mean that they used a sort of exploit to influence a process they normally shouldnt be able to influence I think the widespread use of hacking is starting to have people believe the ruski's actually got their balaclava's on and matrixstyle sneaked their way into the constitution to switch some 1's and 0's ","It is Putin's America","And Russia attacking American troops this week","With Russia I'll believe it when I see it is usually a better approach and even then you have to closely examine it These are the same people who continue to deny any role in the downing of flight MH17 in the face of overwhelming evidence that they were responsible even creating fake satellite images to back up their narrative then sticking by it when it was proved they were fake","It'll just free up more condos for Russians to use to launder money buy","Given that he didn't bring any administration witnesses to the second meeting the Russians can say whatever and he has no way of demonstrating that they are wrong","No one is denying anything It's not the Russians it's not a conspiracy theory Its conspiracy fact and criminal activity just like we've been saying for months Who wears tinfoil now Those denying the leaks are real","When he's paid by the Russians","I agree but certain vulnerable areas were targeted with some intense propaganda Some of it from Russia","Of course he does Putin has him tearing down every institution that made America the leader of the free world","I agree that the FBI has stated it is not yet ready to officially lay blame for the hacks at the feet of the Russians but I dispute the notion that that means the story was therefore bought and paidfor by Clinton That's a bunch of disingenuous horseshit The New York times is reporting that American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have 'high confidence' that the Russian government was behind the hacks It's not saying people close to the investigation or Hillary's contractors it's saying intelligence agencies are reporting this as fact Take that for what it's worth even though that apparently means nothing for you I assume that you would have discredited Deep Throat as well at the time because he was an unnamed source but that's how journalism is done ","haha what if Putin is the hero America needs but doesnt deserve right now ","Check it out article from 2006 gtIn Russia Taylor's primary business partner is a former KGB agent and Supreme Soviet deputy named Boris Bolshakov the two met in the early 1990s through Bolshakov's wife Marina an English teacher who had contacts in the American community at the US Air Force base in Ramstein Germany Seriously WTF is this","Its fascinating how Russia's big plan to bring down America was to do everything they can to get Republicans elected Just goes to show how Republicans are detrimental to America","The same government that told us that the attack in Libya was due to a video is the same government telling us Russians hacked the election Ponder that","There's no precedent for this scenario I'm cool with going old school tarring feathering and kicking Trump's orange ass over to Russia so he spend more time with his Bae ","gtThe charge against Natalia Veselnitskaya relates to a money laundering case separate from the investigation into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election but the court documents provide a detailed account of her close relationship with the Kremlin gt gtVeselnitskaya is best known for offering members of Donald Trumps campaign team supposed dirt on Hillary Clinton in the now infamous meeting at Trump Tower but she was also the lawyer for Prevezon Holdings which was accused of using proceeds from a massive Russian tax fraud scheme to buy property in New York City The lawyer who uncovered the scheme Sergei Magnitsky died a grisly death in a Moscow prison ","I think they're preparing in case we NEED to impeach but more importantly are laying the public groundwork for the fact that this president routinely breaks the law and lies about it Best case scenario Trump loses in 2020 and is immediately charged based on this the mueller findingsetc And if Trump somehow wins in 2020 the House will have found enough that hopefully enough Republicans however many are in the senate by this point will have no choice but to alienate Trumps base Impeachment was never the first nor best option if anything impeachment before 2020 could massively backfire they'll pursue it only if all other options of removing Trump indicting him or what have you do not work I think this is the best step because it avoids the potential political backfire that may happen in a worst case scenario evidence to impeach doesn't sway enough senate republicans and Trump not only wins 2020 but Republicans gain a supermajority in the senate and take back the house almost guaranteeing Trump stays in office until 2024 ","I'm p sure the whole thing is If it does happen we helped If it doesn't we still got a lot of people to submit potentially damaging but not impeachable information on him Which means we still helped Gotta think longer term This isn't at all a beallendall strategy","This is why I don't think I want him impeached tomorrow Ideally time it so that the political fallout is most damaging around the midterms Then there's a chance that dems could at least take control of the senate What worries me more is that he gets thrown under the bus fast and then Pence has enough time to try to legitimize himself Ideally over the next 2 years it gets dragged out enough that Pence can't wash the stink off of himself that easily But yeah Trump is almost a sideshow No matter what goes down in the Executive branch the real scary thing is that the Tea Party Republicans in the House aren't going to be held back by anyone and also he's a big enough of a traffic accident that nobody is paying attention to Congress","How could Pence not start his term with huge disapproval rates if he pardons the idiot in chief","I like to believe they are just hanging this over his head to control him Keeps the Republicans in power and they can just ride this whole thing out for 4 years Take a few people out sure They won't impeach him He won't step down","Not only will America not survive another 4 years of trump America will NOT SURVIVE THE CURRENT TERM Every day that brings us closer to the next election we say that we are okay with a president who recieved foreign Aid during thier presidency and in turn have a debt to pay back to said foreign country that we are okay with the blatant racism and bigatry in our highest office that we are okay with our President obstructing any investigation into him that we are okay with the strangle hold he has on Congress that prevents them from doing thier Constitutional duty that we are okay with these stall tactics that prevent investigation and evidence gathering that we are okay with another Trump Trump has shown us that our system doesnt work Impeachment should have started yesterday It should have started with the release of the Mueller report It should have started with the release of Barrs Summary Americans need to take back America Drop this political party horseshit Get out there and vote Contact your legislators Contact your Represenatives Do not sit quietly Do your God damn research Trump should have never made it past the primaries when everything about him was a complete fucking mystery","Lmao the minute he walks into the courtroom and opens his mouth impeachment proceeding paperwork will start being filed","At this point I dont think its fair that Trump gets impeached We need to send him into exile If he isnt found to be downright traitorous that

deliberate pollution of the conversation to spread discontent and ideological subversion and fracturing Search for Yuri Bezmenov for further details on how that is a deliberate psychological warfare technique the Soviets used and has been picked up by the Chinese muslims hispanics Russians and Europeans too in many less intentional ways ","My money is on selfhating gays and white supremacist Mexicans","Interesting I'm a fan of diversity so the more different types of shit the better IMHO","Its pretty naive to think that a white person with a name similar to criminals in the area would have the same treatment as a black person in the same area My point is that a black person would at best be subjected to far more skepticism and far worse treatment if they claimed that the warrant was for a different person The fact that this is an inconvenience for you instead of something that makes you fear bodily harm is white privilege no ","Yes precisely I don't see many poor whites from appalachia getting million dollar jobs straight out of college The racial twist only turns off potential allies that the SJW's would need to actually get anything done ie poor and middle class whites","My problem with White Privilege stems from the word itself The two groups of people other then Native Americans who suffer the most form economical policies are Black Americans and Rural Poor White Americans These people are all facing economic hardship subtle racist policies poor schooling and historical economic roadblocks that prevent them from rising up easier Black people lost their biggest ally when somone coined the term White Privilege because it shuts down the very people who would benefit off of the Black Lives Matter movement Jimmy the poor coal miner who needs policies in place to help retrain and reeducate would benefit from reform in the govern Just like Deshawn would benefit from beneficial programs and police reform But Jimmy hears White Privilege and shuts down Because he asks Where the hell is my privilege Now as a educated person we all know that White Privilege exists even if the terminology used is inaccurate But Jimmy doesn't see that he hears White Privilege and looks around at his dead town strung out cousin and rightly asks What Privilege And Deshawn gets told Whitey's keeping him down Which is true and associates people like Jimmy with those White People When in fact is has nothing to do with Jimmy and everything to do with the people in governemnt and the complicated system reform that woud be required to turn the ship around TLDR It's fucking complicated and based around long term historical choices of government policies of people with terrible long term stratagy skills taking advantage of their position","He is senile stupid and racist This was clearly about race","The specific point OP is making is that in this climate intent or WHY you said something only seems to matter if you're on their side Take the Pappa Johns guy or any of the other people who've said things that were in the course of a conversation ABOUT racism and discrimination People use the Nword just in MENTIONING that people use it is enough to get you crucified Except certain people Hence the imagine if Trump said something like this","you mad bros seeing a white girl hugging a black boy ","A classic racist trope after civil rights is to say reverse dog whistles with pretended civility or fake reasonableness in order to antagonize and intimidate civicminded people while also lending pride and selfrighteousness to those who assert such divisive arguments It's a racist theater to racebait someone to supposedly 'misinterpret' and take offense then claim 'you said it not me' The fallacy can be exposed by calling the bluff and going allin on the supposed inclusiveness of their position rather than acknowledging the taboo If they want to pretend that it is not racist but instead a reasonable statement of inclusion press them to clarify who they are talking about and what exactly they mean Don't accept empty answers that assert baseless division They have to demonstrate their commitment to civil rights and civil liberties Challenge divisiveness with a demonstration of what racial harmony means Define what systemic equality looks like and how telling people to leave cannot be done so arbitrarily Stand up for our right to stay Telling someone to leave America demands the highest burden of proof for truth justice and the American way Aka them's fightin' words And as Captain America would say no you move","Nah Hitler was a lot smarter than Trump and wasn't afraid to serve his country in war He actually volunteered instead of getting 5 deferments and then took the dangerous job as a messenger while Trump thinks

shrinks when she talks in public Plus she's probably scared of getting asked real questions","This is posturing for not losing her hardened base","We don't need to take any American election changing process advice from an American election rigging loser They never thought she would lose These people are STUPID","She campaigned to get celebrity endorsements instead of majority of Americans","If she were capable of any remorse whatsoever she probably wouldn't have paid people to call people in her own political sphere sore losers after cheating and rigging to win a primary and continued to pay those people to attack the ideology and support of a far more popular candidate from the primary into the general election She is so far absorbed into her own stupidity and hubris even the notion of party unity is completely fucking foreign to her she just imagined that everyone owed her their vote She put her ego above the future of the entire Democratic party Imagine if Barack Obama had made it a visible part of his campaign to continuously attack Hillary supporters and their platform well into the general election and call them racist if they didn't vote for him I mean how fucking stupid can you be Incredibly absurdly stupid apparently","It's not like she did anything wrong anyway","Still valid She might kick the bucket this year still","What about illegal behavior in the White House or State Department Hillary's a fucking expert on both","When I heard her say that it turned my stomach This meme captures that moment perfectly Well done","Well maybe just maybe her supporters wrote off all the previous attacks as some grand conspiracy theory but when she started throwing her medical records in and then the talking points about right to privacy to obscure the Wikileaks emails and then attacking freedom of the press by going after Drudge and Jones you don't have to even believe what they say but as Americans they fucking have a right to say it the payola the kickbacks to the Clinton Foundation the connections to extremist Islamists like Huma's mother who advocates genital mutilation to hosting the father of the Orlando Shooting imagine if Sandy Hook happened this year and the shooter's mother stood behind her the death of a CNN producer the firing of Dr Drew the death of John Ashe Seth Rich etc they are seeing that the only conspiracy going on is one of globalists to

accused of","I like to think she had her people put a homeless guy in a stainless steel chair in a concrete room and she is slowly torturing him to vent","Because she clearly has influential people by the balls somehow or other","Ah shit thank god she reminded me how to spell deal ","Bernie tells friends in Vermont that he likes giving blow jobs","I find it hilarious She literally scammed a bunch

how the crowd of people standing on the tarmac at the bottom of the stairs began to leave as soon as her back was turned amp the look on her face when she turned around to wave goodbye amp saw there was hardly anybody left ","Funny how every time the Clinton's try this it blows up in their face Guess that's what happens when you take the low road Lotsa mud down there Slippery","It's taken a bit out of context She was talking about hope that her husbands campaign built the presidency on So without a successor to his legacy they now know what it's like to live without that hope It's not like she said our country is hopeless ","Because voting for Bill Clinton's wife totally says I'm against cronyism","The way she probably sees it her life's work's culminating in the election in November so she won't drop out while her icy heart's still beating","She looks like the Grinch who stole democracy","You assume that she could actually die","You could have a point there but some of her boldness

eyes open I'm sure she will continue to say and do crazy things ","Hillary didn't underestimate her opposition she over estimated her support There is a difference As much as some people would like to tell you the election was not binary Getting people to understand this especially those on the left is an important step forward for the 2018 and 2020 elections","It didn't matter what her policies were because if you didn't vote her you're against X race and Y ideology","Oh don't get me wrong friend I'm not bold enough to suggest that laws actually apply to her You misunderstand me ","shorten

really am wondering if there is anything she could do and end up imprisoned","I think they do because her bullshit is bad enough that even Trumpanzee's are like lol wut","Because she thinks it's edgy to go into a classroom for learning English and getting them to say stupid stuff And this is from just one of the bumpers I saw Another had her talking to refugees about nonsense Embarrassing those who don't understand English is apparently humor to her On TBS they run her bumpers like crazy I heard she was renewed for another year so I went to her IMDB page to see what all the fuss is Hard

on one she actually dissagrees with Trump and is only with him as a career move I know it sounds crazy but as long as she doesn't catch fire too this could be a career booster Any publicity is good

mate That would be the dream team of vile disgust and the pukometer 5000 would be off the scales","I understand being a Trump supporter I see the appeal i do He is just too unpredictable to take a chance And he can be a pretty nasty guy However i don't think Bernie was controlled opposition If he had not run Hillary would be coasting into the White House Wikileaks would have fallen on deaf ears

she starts blaming others ","I love that Bernie played by the rules and just told the truth and won Meanwhile over in Gotham City we have Hillary Clinton that corrupts everything she touches Or it's

","It's actually affirmative action come home to roost combined with ever loosening immigration standards and the dismantling of democracy and disempowering of white people The agencies have not always been this way it all pretty much started with the affirmative actions imposition of the Bill The Rapist Clinton era It takes time for those types of policies to take affect and fully proliferate and spread throughout the system then it takes some additional time for the rot and negative feedback loop to set in 3 steps forward that are celebrated while the 5 steps back are hidden and obscured Then combine that with the massive damage Bush and his neocon retards did to this country that both infested the government with muslims and foreigners for all the cultural sensitivity and language bullshit in order to win a war that was specifically designed to draw the USA in and mire us in a quagmire Many don't realize that our long time in AFG and IRQ also led to a not insignificant number of our special forces to convert to islam which then move on through the pipeline to the CIA and other IC entities It is a known issue with long and intractable war the soldiers become seduced by the culture when they open themselves up to it in a foolish attempt to gain an advantage But I got a bit sidetracked The bigger problem is not saying anything about anyone it is the unbounded nature in which that happens It is healthy for people to say anything to anyone within a system eg Americans it is a problem when eg the true election meddling that has happened foreigners from Europe and Asia including deliberate efforts funded or orchestrated by foreign nations and their elite in order to propagandize Americans about matters that are their own It's intentional and deliberate pollution of the conversation to spread discontent and ideological subversion and fracturing Search for Yuri Bezmenov for further details on how that is a deliberate psychological warfare technique the Soviets used and has been picked up by the Chinese muslims hispanics Russians and Europeans too in many less intentional ways ","My money is on selfhating gays and white supremacist Mexicans","Interesting I'm a fan of diversity so the more different types of shit the better IMHO","Its pretty naive to think that a white person with a name similar to criminals in the area would have the same treatment as a black person in the same area My point is that a black person would at best be subjected to far more skepticism and far worse treatment if they claimed that the warrant was for a different person The fact that this is an inconvenience for you instead of something that makes you fear bodily harm is white privilege no ","Yes precisely I don't see many poor whites from appalachia getting million dollar jobs straight out of college The racial twist only turns off potential allies that the SJW's would need to actually get anything done ie poor and middle class whites","My problem with White Privilege stems from the word itself The two groups of people other then Native Americans who suffer the most form economical policies are Black Americans and Rural Poor White Americans These people are all facing economic hardship subtle racist policies poor schooling and historical economic roadblocks that prevent them from rising up easier Black people lost their biggest ally when somone coined the term White Privilege because it shuts down the very people who would benefit off of the Black Lives Matter movement Jimmy the poor coal miner who needs policies in place to help retrain and reeducate would benefit from reform in the govern Just like Deshawn would benefit from beneficial programs and police reform But Jimmy hears White Privilege and shuts down Because he asks Where the hell is my privilege Now as a educated person we all know that White Privilege exists even if the terminology used is inaccurate But Jimmy doesn't see that he hears White Privilege and looks around at his dead town strung out cousin and rightly asks What Privilege And Deshawn gets told Whitey's keeping him down Which is true and associates people like Jimmy with those White People When in fact is has nothing to do with Jimmy and everything to do with the people in governemnt and the complicated system reform that woud be required to turn the ship around TLDR It's fucking complicated and based around long term historical choices of government policies of people with terrible long term stratagy skills taking advantage of their position","He is senile stupid and

crucified Except certain people Hence the imagine if Trump said something like this","you mad bros seeing a white girl hugging a black boy ","A classic racist trope after civil rights is to say reverse dog whistles with pretended civility or fake reasonableness in order to antagonize and intimidate civicminded people while also lending pride and selfrighteousness to those who assert such divisive arguments It's a racist theater to racebait someone to supposedly 'misinterpret' and take offense then claim 'you said it not me' The fallacy can be exposed by calling the bluff and going allin on the supposed inclusiveness of their position rather than acknowledging the taboo If they want to pretend that it is not racist but instead a reasonable statement of inclusion press them to clarify who they are talking about and what exactly they mean Don't accept empty answers that assert baseless division They have to demonstrate their commitment to civil rights and civil liberties Challenge divisiveness with a demonstration of what racial harmony means Define what systemic equality looks like and how telling people to leave cannot be done so arbitrarily Stand up for our right to stay Telling someone to leave America demands the highest burden of proof for truth justice and the American way Aka them's fightin' words And as Captain America would say no you move","Nah Hitler

has him tearing down every institution that made America the leader of the free world","I agree that the FBI has stated it is not yet ready to officially lay blame for the hacks at the feet of the Russians but I dispute the notion that that means the story was therefore bought and paidfor by Clinton That's a bunch of disingenuous horseshit The New York times is reporting that American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have 'high confidence' that the Russian government was behind the hacks It's not saying people close to the investigation or Hillary's contractors it's saying intelligence agencies are reporting this as fact Take that for what it's worth even though that apparently means nothing for you I assume that you would have discredited Deep Throat as well at the time because he was an unnamed source but that's how journalism is done ","haha what if Putin is the hero America needs but doesnt deserve right now ","Check it out article from

they can to get Republicans elected Just goes to show how Republicans are detrimental to America","The same government that told us that the attack in Libya was due to a video is the same government

suggested that while she violated the law's willful negligence statute no one had been tried for that and intent was needed The dubiousness of his statement that no one else had been tried for willful negligence aside intent is supposedly what was needed to change his mind if we're to take him at face value that he was ever going to recommend charges It's entirely possible that suggestions of intent are found in Huma's emails that weren't sent directly tofrom Hillary but in the limited review his letter suggests we wouldn't know that yet ","I'm just as fed up with the system as the rest of y'all but if it's known that she used pseudonyms then it would be easy enough to develop a scanning algorithm which they probably already have that looks for them in the same context as her real name

willing to risk their careers as well as their lives in these scenarios As it stands there are none with access to the classified emails that also possesses the intestinal fortitude required to complete the mission Hillary Clinton has committed treason multiple times and should be tried accordingly That is the current endstate How many others will fall with her has yet to be determined Exactly what I'm going to do with the information I have gathered is not important What is important is motivating the people who support this cause into actually spending time each day pulling on the threads the email server scandal has left Actively spreading the information you have gathered to those people in your relationship tree is the second thing that needs to happen Simply coming here and saying Yeah throw that bitch in prison is a masturbatory exercise that nets zero progress","Argued with someone the other day and his argument was Obama knew she was using a personal email from the beginning but didnt know she was using a private email server so his statement is true This is the kind of denial we are dealing with here","The email SoS email scandal should be enough on its own All it takes is a little bit of knowledge on security clearance a teeny tiny bit of skepticism towards her answers in the investigation and a small dose of common sense This bitch is corrupt as all hell

don't remember calling anybody else Or if I on my own said Here are some solutions so that your emails get through to us so that we can place call calls to foreign officials And you know she clearly missed the window in this exchange Q Okay And what did you mean by releasing your email address to the department gtA I'm not sure I would know how to define that then or define that now I might have also just be my my being frustrated back at the fact that I wasn't getting her messages If you just reading the exchange she seems frustrated because she's not able to do her job I seem frustrated

unpunished","I think they're preparing in case we NEED to impeach but more importantly are laying the public groundwork for the fact that this president routinely breaks the law and lies about it Best case scenario Trump loses in 2020 and is immediately charged based on this the mueller findingsetc And if Trump somehow wins in 2020 the House will have found enough that hopefully enough Republicans however many are in the senate by this point will have no choice but to alienate Trumps base Impeachment was never the first nor best option if anything impeachment before 2020 could massively backfire they'll pursue it only if all other options of removing Trump indicting him or what have you do not work I think this is the best step because it avoids the potential political backfire that may happen in a worst case scenario evidence to impeach doesn't sway enough senate republicans and Trump not only wins 2020 but Republicans gain a supermajority in the senate and take back the house almost guaranteeing Trump stays in office until 2024 ","I'm p sure the whole thing is If it does happen we helped If it doesn't we still got a lot of people to submit potentially damaging but not impeachable information on him Which means we still helped Gotta think longer term This isn't at all a beallendall strategy","This is why I don't think I want him impeached tomorrow Ideally time it so that the political fallout is most damaging around the midterms Then there's a chance that dems could at least take control of the senate What worries me more is that he gets thrown under the bus fast and then Pence has enough time to try to legitimize himself Ideally over the next 2 years it gets dragged out enough that Pence can't wash the stink off of himself that easily But yeah Trump is almost a sideshow No matter what goes down in the Executive branch the real scary thing is that the Tea Party Republicans in the House aren't going to be held back by anyone and also he's a big enough of a traffic accident that nobody is paying attention to Congress","How could Pence not start his term with huge disapproval rates if he pardons the idiot in chief","I like to believe they are just hanging this over his head to control him Keeps the Republicans in power and they can just ride this whole thing out for 4 years Take a few people out sure They won't impeach him He won't step down","Not only will America not survive another 4 years of trump America will NOT SURVIVE THE CURRENT TERM Every day that brings us closer to the next election we say that we are okay with a president who recieved foreign Aid during thier presidency and in turn have a debt to pay back to said foreign country that we are okay with the blatant racism and bigatry in our highest office that we are okay with our President obstructing any investigation into him that we are okay with the strangle hold he has on Congress that prevents them from doing thier Constitutional duty that we are okay with these stall tactics that prevent investigation and evidence gathering that we are okay with another Trump Trump has shown us that our system doesnt work Impeachment should have started yesterday It should have started with the release of the Mueller report It should have started with the release of Barrs Summary Americans need to take back America Drop this political party horseshit Get out there and vote Contact your legislators Contact your Represenatives Do not sit quietly Do your God damn research Trump should have never made it past the primaries when everything about him was a complete fucking mystery","Lmao the minute he walks into the courtroom and opens his mouth impeachment proceeding paperwork will start being filed","At this point I dont think its fair that Trump gets impeached We need to send him into exile If he isnt found to be downright traitorous that is ","The FBI You mean the ones that ALREADY declined to prosecute What a circlejerk","Well let's see what the new FBI director can come up with after the acting Director is removed","Seems more like Comey used Bharara to force the hand of the DOJ or something Perhaps the FBI is going to offer Weiner immunity on the pedo case in exchange for rolling over on Abedin and Clinton or something like that Really hard to tell this is pretty nuts News hasn't picked up on it yet I've submitted to Drudge but he hasn't put it up Overall I hope there's some way to get people's attention about this","Ah but you forget that Comey added the we can't prove intent if you are an elite phrase to all the applicable laws","Correct The Intelligence IG report does have the teeth of criminal indictments as well I believe that IG is also the one who recommended this to the FBI ","Had they not been dicking around with this bullshit they might have stopped one of these school shootings Brennan Clapper Comey should be in leg irons","I would love to see the inside of the investigating FBI field offices and journo pits

ever loosening immigration standards and the dismantling of democracy and disempowering of white people The agencies have not always been this way it all pretty much started with the affirmative actions imposition of the Bill The Rapist Clinton era It takes time for those types of policies to take affect and fully proliferate and spread throughout the system then it takes some additional time for the rot and negative feedback loop to set in 3 steps forward that are celebrated while the 5 steps back are hidden and obscured Then combine that with the massive damage Bush and his neocon retards did to this country that both infested the government with muslims and foreigners for all the cultural sensitivity and language bullshit in order to win a war that was specifically designed to draw the USA in and mire us in a quagmire Many don't realize that our long time in AFG and IRQ also led to a not insignificant number of our special forces to convert to islam which then move on through the pipeline to the CIA and other IC entities It is a known issue with long and intractable war the soldiers become seduced by the culture when they open themselves up to it in a foolish attempt to gain an advantage But I got a bit sidetracked The bigger problem is not saying anything about anyone it is the unbounded nature in which that happens It is healthy for people to say anything to anyone within a system eg Americans it is a problem when eg the true election meddling that has happened foreigners from Europe and Asia including deliberate efforts funded or orchestrated by foreign nations and their elite in order to propagandize Americans about matters that are their own It's intentional and deliberate pollution of the conversation to spread discontent and ideological subversion and fracturing Search for Yuri Bezmenov for further details on how that is a deliberate psychological warfare technique the Soviets used and has been picked up by the Chinese

that a black person would at best be subjected to far more skepticism and far worse treatment if they claimed that the warrant was for a different person The fact that this is an inconvenience for you instead of something that makes you fear bodily harm is white privilege no ","Yes precisely I don't see many poor whites from appalachia getting million dollar jobs straight out of college The racial twist only turns off potential allies that the SJW's would need to actually get anything done ie poor and middle class whites","My problem with White Privilege stems from the word itself The two groups of people other then Native Americans who suffer the most form economical policies are Black Americans and Rural Poor White Americans These people are all facing economic hardship subtle racist policies poor schooling and historical economic roadblocks that prevent them from rising up easier Black people lost their biggest ally when somone coined the term White Privilege because it shuts down the very people who would benefit off of the Black Lives Matter movement Jimmy the poor coal miner who needs policies in place to help retrain and reeducate would benefit from reform in the govern Just like Deshawn would benefit from beneficial programs and police reform But Jimmy hears White Privilege and shuts down Because he asks Where the hell is my privilege Now as a educated person we all know that White Privilege exists even if the terminology used is inaccurate But Jimmy doesn't see that he hears White Privilege and looks around at his dead town strung out cousin and rightly asks What Privilege And Deshawn gets told Whitey's keeping him down Which is true and associates people like Jimmy with those White People When in fact is has nothing to do with Jimmy and everything to do with the people in governemnt and the complicated system reform that woud be required to turn the ship around TLDR It's fucking complicated and based around long term historical choices of government policies of people with terrible long term stratagy skills taking advantage of their position","He is senile stupid and racist This was clearly about race","The specific point OP is making

acknowledging the taboo If they want to pretend that it is not racist but instead a reasonable statement of inclusion press them to clarify who they are talking about and what exactly they mean Don't accept empty answers that assert baseless division They have to demonstrate their commitment to civil rights and civil liberties Challenge divisiveness with a demonstration of what racial harmony

<h1 id="topics-by-subreddit" class="anchor-link"><a href="#topics-by-subreddit">Topics by subreddit</a></h1>
<p>What sets BerTopic apart is that by leveraging c-TF-IDF we can examine how the topics differ between specific predefined classes, such as the subreddits they were posted in. Up until this point we treated r/HillaryForPrison and r/ImpeachTrump as if they were one entity, which they are clearly not. Even from the names alone it’s obvious that they represent completely different political ideologies. They share the goal or the hope of legal action against their political opponent, however, which might mean that it is likely we’ll find both shared as well as separate topics.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># get topic representations per class</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Clicking through the visualization below it can be seen that r/HillaryForPrison talked about topics 0 (putting Hillary Clinton &amp; Bernie Sanders in prison) and 7 (the email scandal) vastly more than r/ImpeachTrump. r/ImpeachTrump talked more about the electoral system (topic 1) and about taxes, jobs and the economy (topic 4), as well as impeaching Trump (duh!) and fascism.</p>
<p>On most other topics, there seems to be more activity in r/HillaryForPrison - this could be because the subreddit contains more comments (though not by much!) or because conservatives rally behind a smaller selection of key topics, while the range of topics is bigger for progressives.</p>
<p>It might be interesting to examine how sentiment varies between these topics and/or to set lower limits for min_topic_size so subtopics can be explored in more detail. An interesting example of this is topic 5, where both subreddits talk about the media. The topic contains the keywords fox news and breitbart, two right-wing news outlets/tabloids and CNN, which is more democratically aligned. Both subreddits engage in this topic frequently, but likely with much different talking points and sentiment.</p>

<h1 id="topics-over-time" class="anchor-link"><a href="#topics-over-time">Topics over time</a></h1>
<p>Similar to how we can examine how the topics differ and align between the two subreddits, we can also check and visualize how they develop over time. Especially in political subreddits like r/HillaryForPrison and r/ImpeachTrump it stands to reason that some topics would be greatly influenced by current events. Perhaps these could also be the topics that trend in both subreddits at the same time. Other topics might be ‘evergreens’, like Trump fans bitching about the bad, bad system media.</p>
<p>Timestamps for the comments are saved in POSIX epoch time (seconds since Jan 01, 1970) and need to be converted to date time format in order to model the topics over time. Re-calculating the c-TF-IDF for each time point is computationally very expensive, so it’s necessary to reduce the dimensionality by retaining only year and month. Even with this greatly reduced input space and the relatively small corpus size training takes over 1 hour.</p>

<p>Some topics, however, appear to be influenced by political events of the day (other than the election) more than others. These are topics 6 (russian involvement in US politics), 8 (racism &amp; white privilege) and 10 (actually impeaching Trump). All of these are more aligned to r/ImpeachTrump and therefore could retain importance even after the election.</p>
