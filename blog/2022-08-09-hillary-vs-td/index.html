<section id="intro" class="level1">
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>In 2016 I was studying Psychology at the University of Innsbruck, and I had no idea where to go afterwards. I had just finished my Bachelor’s thesis knew one thing: I wasn’t made for clinical psychology. I didn’t really want to work with patients. But I also had discovered the research process, and I felt there might be a path forwards for me within science.</p>
<p>What interested me most was how modern big data technologies could be applied to questions in Psychology. How we could use the massive amounts of unstructured text and image data that are generated daily to gain insights into the human mind.</p>
<p>I jumped right in and two years later analysed over 20 million comments on Reddit to examine how the moral values we express in text change through group dynamics over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Reddit is an under-utilized source of data. It’s relatively anonymous, messy, and huge. It seemed like a natural choice to go back to in order to learn more about transformers and their applications. So here it is: my first attempt at using BerTopic to extract what users of r/HillaryForPrison and r/ImpeachTrump (for some balance) talked about.</p>
<p>The great thing about BerTopic is that it doesn’t just provide out of the box topic modelling, it also allows us to examine how the topics differ between these two subreddits and how they developed over time.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-cleaning" class="level1">
<h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
<p>From the BerTopic documentation:</p>
<p>“Should I preprocess the data?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;By using document embeddings there is typically no need to preprocess the data as all parts of a document are important in understanding the general topic of the document. Although this holds true in 99% of cases, if you have data that contains a lot of noise, for example, HTML-tags, then it would be best to remove them. HTML-tags typically do not contribute to the meaning of a document and should therefore be removed.”</p>
<p>Seems like I don’t have to do much data cleaning. Because Reddit comments are not necessarily ‘clean’, I quickly looped over the data to remove any non-alphanumeric characters (except for punctuation). Empty comments &amp; known bots are already removed. In addition, after some trial and error, I also removed all links and hashtags, because these resulted in several rather meaningless topics.</p>

<h1>Fitting the Model</h1>
<p>In the first step the sentence transformer model is imported and document embeddings are created.</p>

<p>Then we can define custom UMAP &amp; HDBSCAN models to reduce the embedding dimension and perform document clustering. In order to speed up this process we preprocess and initialize with PCA embeddings. Originally I was planning to do this for r/TheDonald and r/SandersForPresident (and I’m still planning to at some point), but even with 128 GB of RAM the model wouldn’t fit into memory, so I had to settle for two smaller subreddits.</p>
<p>There’s also the option to move computation to GPU, but with this data set the topic model takes only about 5-10 minutes to execute, so the added work is not necessary.</p>

<p>While the UMAP model uses mostly the default values, I chose to set the min_cluster_size for the HDBSCAN to 1000 - otherwise we’d get lots of very rare topics.</p>

<section id="visualization" class="level1">
<h1>Visualization</h1>
<p>There are few hard rules what constitutes a good topic model. In the end it all boils down to whether the topics that are extracted are meaningful and interpretable. BerTopic provides a host of out of the box visualizations that can help to better understand the extracted topics and to ultimately make sense of the underlying documents.</p>
<section id="distance-matrix" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distance-matrix">Distance Matrix</h2>
<p>The first of these is the distance matrix. Topics are projected into two-dimensional space to enable us to interpret how they relate to each other (or rather how the algorithm projects those relations).</p>
<p>I chose a relatively low number of topics (or rather a large min_document_size) for easier interpretability, but of course this can obscure the hierarchical clustering and relations between topics to some extent.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topic-hierarchy">Topic hierarchy</h2>
<p>The hierarchy of topics can be visualized through a dendrogram, just like any hierarchical clustering algorithm. If two topics are connected closer to the origin of the x-axis, they are also closer in the text - and there’s a good chance they might be overlapping. Topics that are further away on the y-axis are less closely related to each other, meaning they co-occur less frequently.</p>

GROUND","1 Flynn is only not going to prison because he's flipping on OTHER people Did you think he got that sweetheart sentence on like one charge instead of ALL the FARA and other violations never mind the conspiracy to kidnap issue among others just because Mueller likes the guy His lack of going to prison is only because more people are going to get charged based on his help Given who he is that virtually guarantees it will be information leading to people who arewere in the administration rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that the vast majority of the FBI and intel agencies at large were overall supportive of Clinton instead of Trump Where is the expectation that the people investigating you have to be political supporters of you Are the only people in the FBI that are allowed to go after the mob Italians who are sympathetic to Sicilian crime families The only people who can arrest terrorists are selfavowed Muslims That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the Clinton investigation because I also hate that bitch but by all appearances most decisions and documents were prepared as a group rather than Strzok being responsible for any unilateral decisions on his own But keep trying","veteranstodaycom appears to be forbidden by the Reddit

rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that

That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

get Democrats to demand an investigation so that Trump's hands are cleaner Best case scenario Trump's opposition demanded their own downfall and he won't appear to critics to be destroying the Republic to consolidate his power Worst case scenario it's not going to happen I'm not sure what I believe Locking Hillary Clinton up wasn't a real campaign promise though I do think he strongly

rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that the vast majority of the FBI and intel agencies at large were overall supportive of Clinton instead of Trump Where is the expectation that the people investigating you have to be political supporters of you Are the only people in the FBI that are allowed to go after the mob Italians who are sympathetic to Sicilian crime families The only people who can arrest terrorists are selfavowed Muslims That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that

That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to

rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that

That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

people with high level security clearances and I know how incredibly seriously the government takes this shit when it comes to regular people and I have spent enough time researching and know enough details about what she did to understand the immense gravity of the situation she had fucking SAP information on her personal private unsecured server that I'm very very sensitive to this issue especially with things that are going on in my life right now Plus the precedent this sets regarding security and corruption when it comes to political elites is also just disastrous When it comes to Hillary's issues and especially the mishandling classified information thing which as I've said I'm particularly sensitive to I stop giving a fuck about Bernie or Trump or Democrats or Republicans or

rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that the vast majority of the FBI and intel agencies at large were overall supportive of Clinton instead of Trump Where is the expectation that the people investigating you have to be political supporters of you Are the only people in the FBI that are allowed to go after the mob Italians who are sympathetic to Sicilian crime families The only people who can arrest terrorists are selfavowed Muslims That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

election I've voted in that I felt I voted for the lesser of two evils","Michael Vu is hillary clinton's election fraud specialist","Src Chance of it going anywhere before electors choose on the 19th My bet is zero Plant crystal lady has no hope","Trump is an idiot but the bush jr admin was pure evil and is the worst president of all time don't let s gorilla in lipstick distract you from the wolves who paraded him into the picture","Rumor is Trump will nominate Chris Christie as AG and that guy will go medieval on their asses A house cleaning of epic proportions It all makes sense Trump has been assaulted by the media like no other candidate has before A president Trump is the worst case scenario for the corrupt establishment ","I don't give a shit about Donald Trump I give a shit about calling out all the shit I see Clinton's shit the shit that's jumping to bullshit conclusions about Clinton Trump's shit the lot of it I'm absolutely fed up with the entire system I don't have

week before the electionand a lot of fake news was generated and spread in the day or two before the election which would be less reflected in the model","The sole party for information on Election Night about the vote count election analysis and election projections ","I didn't vote tRump but I would've voted for Kasich","Except they're not getting what they want They're just lowinfo voters","Maybe because that's the part you are so blatantly wrong about Of course he's a nonviable candidate at this point The states have voted You aren't any more observant for pointing out the obvious Acting like the difference between 54 and 90 is only fudging numbers a little bit is the part that's ludicrous","Seriously guys I'm not even American and I have anxiety when I think about this guy Aren't there parts of your constitution written around removing a president from power if he's a dick weed It's only going to end badly for everybody if he stays in power I don't even see it ending well if he were to step down on his own terms tomorrow cause shit is in motion that shouldn't be in motion and it's little things like these that we will look back on one day and shake our heads at ourselves for letting this happen ","Every single democrat is now saying a version of this","Thats the problem with Trump he does not care enough to pretend","That quote is literally saying trump is still worse","Nothing scarier than a president that is above the law","It excludes democrats too","Of those two only one of the reasons have any compelling force over voters","Which was purely symbolic because Clinton was guaranteed to lose the college Had she won by an amount equal to the number of faithless electors you can bet your ass there'd be serious trouble for those electors","It's what everyone does It's sad because you take a point that already should be addressed by Trump you embellish it to make it look worse Now it can be called fake news and you've invalidated the entire point in the eyes of the opposition ","Have you seen the movie Inside Out It's about all these different emotions controlling their human from inside their head Trump talks like he's being controlled by those emotions except they're all on bath salts","Good point He would normally be on the primary ballot for the GOP It would be interesting to have a different candidate on the GOP side in California for the general election","and it has to be before the election ends","Obama is on his way to making the Clintons look like homeless people","Well if a GOP lobbyist says so","Don't forget 191 million voter's registration information was leaked and most states now have online registration that only needs your driver's license to verify","gt Democrat Chuck Shumer respects Trump's ability to compromise and negotiate snort","I doubt they will this year but aside from sideline Republicans nothing on my list requires any action from congress either way Even gun control would begin with Clinton appointing anti2A justices","So who was worst of all time","Yeah Democrats won't vote in 2018 They always find some excuse not to vote Faced with total national disaster they bitched about a paid fluff speech to a bank And now a lot of my family will lose health insurance and will go bankrupt if they break a leg Thanks assholes","Are you one of them If thats the case then i guess you get good benefits from this Well in either case you wouldn't have cared if you are that rich Its quite interesting to see that the young people that are getting a benefit and the old generations thats led this guy's win are fucked over Its also interesting to see some people who earn 5060k or below per year supporting these things These are the people most often than not will need the social benefit structure mostly or their children will I mean they are not rich by any means but think they are So strange","Well if you follow the money where the fuck do you think it will go","That's assuming a lot considering we haven't seen his tax returns","gt make america great again What's wrong with it now Why do you hate America","It is essentially a tax that affects the poor and middle class to a much higher degree than the rich This is the perfect way for Trump to pay for the owner of your companys tax cut By having you pay for it","At least the military spending makes sense since they'll need to defend themselves from all of the angry people who do not have health insurance ","I just would like to know how this would be better than poor people taking shitty jobs people who make a decent amount of money should be worried that they will get fired and their company will hire someone else for half the pay","Aaaaand that's attitude that's going to make America fall from its place as a world power and make the other countries of our world all hate us which no matter how much you say 'fuck them' will hurt us very badly ","The GREED seems almost pathologicalhow much money does one need","Shouldn't feel that way Corporations need cheap labor until they can get more and better robots driverless vehicles and androids","What the fuck are you

arguably to the fullest like he has now Now he has a hot wife and is a billionaire president I hate him but it's not all about the numbers","I guarantee you trump has never done a lick of academic work He payed someone to do it all for him There is no doubt","I think you're focusing on the wrong part I believe this is 100 true because the windfall from these tax cuts seem to be the only logical

economic statistics Inflation is over 30 but according to government's statistics bureau it is 8","What about all that federal funding Be careful","gtAccording to Philly Mag Trump couldnt afford his

have made I have said the same thing in the last two posts that I am about to say again here he stated that he supports raising the FEDERAL which over rides state laws min wage to 10 gtWhy do you think Trump prefers to pay Mexicans 2 an hour instead of an American worker at the minimum wage His various business interests employ over 35k people When you say why do you think Trump hired you make it sound as if he personally works as the director of human resources of every subsidiary he owns But yeah there are unscrupulous managers under him and in many other corporations looking to save a buck gtCapitalism isn't rocket science There are countless variables at play in global economics and upsetting the wrong ones could have a butterfly effect which could result in worldwide recessions

early 2009 Secretary Clinton did not set up the account Although Secretary Clinton does not have specific knowledge of the details of the accounts creation her best understanding is th at one of

Obama nominated you to be Secretary of State and during your tenure as secretary did you expect the St ate Department to receive FOIA requests for or concerning your email Response Secretary Clinton does not recall whether she had a speci fic expectation that the State Department would receive FOIA request s for or concerning her email She understood that because her practice was to email State

very much about and that is much bigger than this one presidential election When it comes to Hillary not only am I very alarmed by her corruption and her disastrous record and how secretive and nontransparent she is but especially the corruption because of how insidious and hazardous to democracy that is the server issue is something I personally care a lot about because I know a lot of people with high level security clearances and I know how incredibly seriously the government takes this shit when it comes to regular people and I have spent enough time researching and know enough details about what she did to understand the immense gravity of the situation she had fucking SAP information on her personal private unsecured server that I'm very very sensitive to this issue especially with things that are going on in my life right now Plus the precedent this sets regarding security and corruption when it comes to political elites is also just disastrous When it comes to Hillary's issues and especially the mishandling classified information thing which as I've said I'm particularly sensitive to I stop giving a fuck about Bernie or Trump or Democrats or Republicans or

Democrats who hated Comey now love him it has nothing to do with loving or hating the man It's not about the man it's about the job He was doing his job investigating potential ties between Russia and the Trump administration and just as that investigation started to bear actual potential fruit he was fired out of the blue And he'll be replaced by who now do you think Someone who is much more sympathetic to the Trump administration who is more likely to let that aforementioned fruit rot on the vine He is clearly doing this to try and obfuscate the truth Nixon tried it back in the 70's and

rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that

That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

early 2009 Secretary Clinton did not set up the account Although Secretary Clinton does not have specific knowledge of the details of the accounts creation her best understanding is th at one of

Obama nominated you to be Secretary of State and during your tenure as secretary did you expect the St ate Department to receive FOIA requests for or concerning your email Response Secretary Clinton does not recall whether she had a speci fic expectation that the State Department would receive FOIA request s for or concerning her email She understood that because her practice was to email State

very much about and that is much bigger than this one presidential election When it comes to Hillary not only am I very alarmed by her corruption and her disastrous record and how secretive and nontransparent she is but especially the corruption because of how insidious and hazardous to democracy that is the server issue is something I personally care a lot about because I know a lot of people with high level security clearances and I know how incredibly seriously the government takes this shit when it comes to regular people and I have spent enough time researching and know enough details about what she did to understand the immense gravity of the situation she had fucking SAP information on her personal private unsecured server that I'm very very sensitive to this issue especially with things that are going on in my life right now Plus the precedent this sets regarding security and corruption when it comes to political elites is also just disastrous When it comes to Hillary's issues and especially the mishandling classified information thing which as I've said I'm particularly sensitive to I stop giving a fuck about Bernie or Trump or Democrats or Republicans or

Democrats who hated Comey now love him it has nothing to do with loving or hating the man It's not about the man it's about the job He was doing his job investigating potential ties between Russia and the Trump administration and just as that investigation started to bear actual potential fruit he was fired out of the blue And he'll be replaced by who now do you think Someone who is much more sympathetic to the Trump administration who is more likely to let that aforementioned fruit rot on the vine He is clearly doing this to try and obfuscate the truth Nixon tried it back in the 70's and

prison is only because more people are going to get charged based on his help Given who he is that virtually guarantees it will be information leading to people who arewere in the administration rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that the vast majority of the FBI and intel agencies at large were overall supportive of Clinton instead of Trump Where is the expectation that the people investigating you have to be political supporters of you Are the only people in the FBI that are allowed to go after the mob Italians who are sympathetic to Sicilian crime families The only people who can arrest terrorists are selfavowed Muslims That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that the vast majority of the FBI and intel agencies at large were overall supportive of Clinton instead of Trump Where is the expectation that the people investigating you have to be political supporters of you Are the only people in the FBI that are allowed to go after the mob Italians who are sympathetic to Sicilian crime families The only people who can arrest terrorists are selfavowed Muslims That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the Clinton investigation because I also hate that bitch but by all appearances most decisions and documents were prepared as a group rather than Strzok being responsible for any unilateral decisions on

above and beyond his support for her Even the professional politicos were commenting how unusual it was for a sitting president to campaign so hard for a nominee","He doesn't have anything to gain from it either though She burnt up all her political goodwill on the last election She doesn't have much left to offer him and I doubt he has many personal or ideological ties to her given how they opposed each other back in 2008 It's pretty plain that their alliance was more out of political necessity than anything else She had the strings to the dems He had the nomination She gave him her

think that's an impossible guess to make They likely know the answer already so it's not to gather information It might be to test how cooperative she is as a witness but that can be done in private

with dark money and corruption the email scandal is not about emails Its about corrupt deal making at the expense of the united states citizens We are strategically misinformed ","But she obviously took care to make sure any sensitive material was purged and destroyed Along with the revelation that past SOS's have used private servers it seems like she did what anyone in that position would do She obviously wasnt careless if its been so hard to find these emails","It's even worse than that From the FBI's statement today gt None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by fulltime security staff like those found at Departments and Agencies of the US Governmentor even with a commercial service like Gmail","More disturbing to consider the relevance of email technology in enlightening the public This type of exposure through leaks would have never been possible when things were done on paper as acquiring the materials would have taken nothing short of raiding government facilities and physically removing

any specific consultations regarding the decision to use th e clintonemailcom account for official State Department business After President Obama nominated you to be Secretary of State and during your tenure as secretary did you expect the St ate Department to receive FOIA requests for or concerning your email Response Secretary Clinton does not recall whether she had a speci fic expectation that the State Department would receive FOIA request s for or concerning her email She understood that because her practice was to email State De partment staff on their stategov accounts her e mail

email exchange with Huma Abedin attached as Exhibit B to Plaint iffs Interrogatories was triggered by a problem with the State Departments telephone system When Secretary Clinton wrote This is not a good system she was referring to the way in wh ich the State Department would notify her of telephone calls Secretary Clin ton does not recall what prec isely she meant by the words address or device To the best of her re collection she meant that she was willing to use a State Department email account or device if it would resolve the problems with receiving telephone calls so long as her personal emails w ith family and friends would not be accessible to the State Department Following this email exchange the State Department changed the way in which it notified Secretary Cl inton of telephone calls resolving the problem that triggered this email ","What emails show that And why wasn't she charged Trump campaigned on locking her up if there are emails that clearly show fraud why didn't Sessions attempt to being charges ","Could you elaborate because the article I linked to says about 60000 were sent and about half of those were deleted and later recovered what other emails were deleted and might be requested from Putin ","Not OP but thanks For me Bernie and the issues he champions are one thing which I care very much about and that is much bigger than this one presidential election When it comes to Hillary not only am I very alarmed by her corruption and her disastrous record and how secretive and nontransparent she is but especially the corruption because of how insidious and hazardous to democracy that is the server issue is something I personally care a lot about because I know a lot of people with high level security clearances and I know how incredibly seriously the government takes this shit when it comes to regular people and I have spent enough time researching and know enough details about what she did to understand the immense gravity of the situation she had fucking SAP information on her personal private unsecured server that I'm very very sensitive to this issue especially with things that are going on in my life right now Plus the precedent this sets regarding security and corruption when it comes to political elites is also just disastrous When it comes to Hillary's issues and especially the mishandling classified information thing which as I've said I'm particularly sensitive to I stop giving a fuck about Bernie or Trump or Democrats or Republicans or winning or anything else The reason I'm so upset about this has nothing to do with Bernie My concern is that she not be allowed to be elected president","and he was investigated for it pretty heavily Had he not had nonclassified sources he could point to there would have been people put in prison","Not true That's like saying that cops can't charge someone with resisting arrest if there isn't a reason for the arrest","No its the truth Rockafeller You are guilty of many of the same crimes","There is no caught if there is no conviction","Some people don't know what to make of me A criminal A felon A thief","No one is going to jail Not saying they don't deserve it but nothing will happen ","Sure Let's throw everyone in Washington in jail I doubt very many of them are innocent But before we can do that we need to take out the Deep State that's holding the wider law enforcement officials back","Fuck banishment these people deserve to die in jail","This exactly Despite the bluster we hear from both sides neither side is really interested in making punishment for people at their level a thing we can realistically and reliably expect","Wait how did I miss him being sent to prison I really took my finger off the pulse that year didn't I","You cannot charge a husband and wife for the same crime","gt Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President","I dont want to win I want Trump Impeached and I need Republicans to do it","No the reason he won't get impeached is because the GOP cares more about tax cuts for the rich and killing Medicare than it does about whether or not he leads us into world war 3 ","Finally his party is telling him to shut up Fortunately for the impeachment process it's to late","They already don't have a choice Why did the democrats dangle impeachment til Trump is almost out of office This shit has been so god damn disgusting","You need a simple majority in the house to impeach and a 23 majority in the senate to convict Not a chance of that IMO ","What part of impeaching Trump would be a waste of time are folks not understanding McConnell has already said he will quash any impeachment moves Let Pelosi do her thing For once the dems are thinking in the long term They're doing lots of investigations She wants to insure their case is air tight Trump is slimy I have always said why impeach when he should be indicted because he is an actual criminal He should be in prison Impeaching him just gives him more power and distractions for the media Democrats better get it together and stay together I always liked Beto but now I want him to let the real professionals do their jobs No infighting they need to be cohesive across the board","There is a mechanism for dealing with a crook as president impeachment The executive position is not above the law there is just one more step to take before the person in that position can be rendered up for justice they have to be removed from that position Then they are subject to the process of civil and criminal justice just like any other citizen The impeachment structure ensures that this can happen But it only works if the Congress does its fucking job and places patriotism before party","The Dems fell all over themselves to praise his integrity He's a Golden Child now Think about how great a RICO case would be in the wake of that Plus he got Chaffetz to give a congressional referral for him to investigate her for perjury I still trust that Comey has something up his sleeve He does not like Clinton She got away from him once twice edit added ty to those who reminded me it's twice","Comey should go to jail as an accomplice","For those trying to point out that Democrats who hated Comey now love him it has nothing to do with loving or hating the man It's not about the man it's about the job He was doing his job investigating potential ties between Russia and the Trump administration and just as that investigation started to bear actual potential fruit he was fired out of the blue And he'll be replaced by who now do you think Someone who is much more sympathetic to the Trump administration who is more likely to let that aforementioned fruit rot on the vine He is clearly doing this to try and obfuscate the truth Nixon tried it back in the 70's and it blew up in his face Let's see how Trump does","There are a lot of reasons comey doesn't like her and a lot of reasons Obama won't call him off ","This is hilarious FBI is the fucking Keystone Cops","Comey lied under oath","What Comey won't or will do the Republican congress will do In fact with Obama's fingerprints all over this he could be vulnerable

sweetheart sentence on like one charge instead of ALL the FARA and other violations never mind the conspiracy to kidnap issue among others just because Mueller likes the guy His lack of going to prison is only because more people are going to get charged based on his help Given who he is that virtually guarantees it will be information leading to people who arewere in the administration rather than just the campaign 2 Briefly part of the campaign and fired Are you guys back to ohh they were just the coffee guy talking point again The dude was the fucking campaign manager He approached Trump in February was part of the campaign by March and put in charge in June after the original manager was fired He served up until his Russia connections became public and heavily reported on Anyone involved in politics was aware of it well before so the claim he was fired when they learned of his connections is about as stink filled bullshit as the claim that Flynn was fired for his issues and lying to Pence when the administration was warned about Flynn by Yates Cummings etc Manafort was fired because the Russia story was making the whole campaign look bad not because they found out about it They were well aware At least once he left they didn't have any other suspicious ties to Russia within their campaign andor administration though s 3 Mueller has just charged the first people with crimes outside anything administration related That doesn't mean he hasn't found evidence of crimes INSIDE the administration like the almost obvious obstruction charge he's likely locking up with evidence now It just gives him leverage and allows him to start indicting people without giving away too much to the other people he's still investigating who would become aware of what things he's focused on unless they all get charged at once You do understand this is a common prosecutorial strategy when dealing with a large group involved in possible crimes right Saying that just because the crimes so far involved noncampaign stuff means there's no campaign related crimes is like the silly claim that just because the FBI hasn't held a press conference declaring Trump directly under investigation it means he definitely isn't under direct investigation despite all evidence to the contrary 4 Oh my Strzok didn't like Trump how crazy We knew before the election that the vast majority of the FBI and intel agencies at large were overall supportive of Clinton instead of Trump Where is the expectation that the people investigating you have to be political supporters of you Are the only people in the FBI that are allowed to go after the mob Italians who are sympathetic to Sicilian crime families The only people who can arrest terrorists are selfavowed Muslims That's obfuscation of the real issue Never mind that from a practical standpoint Strzok being proClintonantiTrump is MUCH more concerning for HER investigation than HIS It's a hell of a lot easier to not pursue leads or sink critical evidence than it is to fabricate evidence against a sitting President to make a crime appear where none actually occurred I'm all for reviewing his actions during the

above and beyond his support for her Even the professional politicos were commenting how unusual it was for a sitting president to campaign so hard for a nominee","He doesn't have anything to gain from it either though She burnt up all her political goodwill on the last election She doesn't have much left to offer him and I doubt he has many personal or ideological ties to her given how they opposed each other back in 2008 It's pretty plain that their alliance was more out of political necessity than anything else She had the strings to the dems He had the nomination She gave him her

leadership so that she would be the democratic nominee FYI thats not just against internal Democratic Party rules that's against US election law for primaries When running in a primary political parties are categorized differently than an a corporation or PAC would be Why is this important Taxes and money think about how many people have been defrauded when they donated thinking it was going

","The point of contention was with her screwing over Sanders The reason we now have a buffoon for a president is because of her Edit Also to add unless we call out these people for doing this the right will continue to rail against a corrupt media that helped her Unless something is done about this the Dems will take exponentially longer to recover ","I'm guessing she's not going to be taking

think that's an impossible guess to make They likely know the answer already so it's not to gather information It might be to test how cooperative she is as a witness but that can be done in private

<h1>Topics by subreddit</h1>
<p>What sets BerTopic apart is that by leveraging c-TF-IDF we can examine how the topics differ between specific predefined classes, such as the subreddits they were posted in. Up until this point we treated r/HillaryForPrison and r/ImpeachTrump as if they were one entity, which they are clearly not. Even from the names alone it’s obvious that they represent completely different political ideologies. They share the goal or the hope of legal action against their political opponent, however, which might mean that it is likely we’ll find both shared as well as separate topics.</p>

<p>Clicking through the visualization below it can be seen that r/HillaryForPrison talked about topics 0 (putting Hillary Clinton &amp; Bernie Sanders in prison) and 7 (the email scandal) vastly more than r/ImpeachTrump. r/ImpeachTrump talked more about the electoral system (topic 1) and about taxes, jobs and the economy (topic 4), as well as impeaching Trump (duh!) and fascism.</p>
<p>On most other topics, there seems to be more activity in r/HillaryForPrison - this could be because the subreddit contains more comments (though not by much!) or because conservatives rally behind a smaller selection of key topics, while the range of topics is bigger for progressives.</p>
<p>It might be interesting to examine how sentiment varies between these topics and/or to set lower limits for min_topic_size so subtopics can be explored in more detail. An interesting example of this is topic 5, where both subreddits talk about the media. The topic contains the keywords fox news and breitbart, two right-wing news outlets/tabloids and CNN, which is more democratically aligned. Both subreddits engage in this topic frequently, but likely with much different talking points and sentiment.</p>

<h1>Topics over time</h1>
<p>Similar to how we can examine how the topics differ and align between the two subreddits, we can also check and visualize how they develop over time. Especially in political subreddits like r/HillaryForPrison and r/ImpeachTrump it stands to reason that some topics would be greatly influenced by current events. Perhaps these could also be the topics that trend in both subreddits at the same time. Other topics might be ‘evergreens’, like Trump fans bitching about the bad, bad system media.</p>
<p>Timestamps for the comments are saved in POSIX epoch time (seconds since Jan 01, 1970) and need to be converted to date time format in order to model the topics over time. Re-calculating the c-TF-IDF for each time point is computationally very expensive, so it’s necessary to reduce the dimensionality by retaining only year and month. Even with this greatly reduced input space and the relatively small corpus size training takes over 1 hour.</p>

<p>Training the model is again very easy and can be done in a single line. It would perhaps be even more interesting to combine the topics_per_class and topics_over_time, but this is not yet implemented in BerTopic, so it would require a lot more custom code - that’s for another day.</p>

<p>It’s not surprising to see that in general most activity is centered around the 2016 election. After all, r/HillaryForPrison is the bigger subreddit and Hillary Clinton became less politically relevant than Donald Trump in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Some topics, however, appear to be influenced by political events of the day (other than the election) more than others. These are topics 6 (russian involvement in US politics), 8 (racism &amp; white privilege) and 10 (actually impeaching Trump). All of these are more aligned to r/ImpeachTrump and therefore could retain importance even after the election.</p>
