      <description>When I started freelancing, I quickly realized that administration and project management eat into your time like nothing else. Many days I would spend more than half my working time on tasks that did not generate any income &amp;ndash; answering emails, managing appointments, recording when I worked for how long on what and writing invoices.
Over time I went from filling every invoice and time sheet by hand in word, via paying for an overpriced online time tracking and invoicing tool to using a custom R package for administration.</description>
