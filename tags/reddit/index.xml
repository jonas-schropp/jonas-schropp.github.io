      <description>Intro In 2016 I was studying Psychology at the University of Innsbruck, and I had no idea where to go afterwards. I had just finished my Bachelor’s thesis knew one thing: I wasn’t made for clinical psychology. I didn’t really want to work with patients. But I also had discovered the research process, and I felt there might be a path forwards for me within science.
What interested me most was how modern big data technologies could be applied to questions in Psychology.</description>
